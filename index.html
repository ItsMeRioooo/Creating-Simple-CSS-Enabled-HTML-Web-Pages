<ol id="ol1nirio">
<li>Clearly define your business idea and be able to succinctly articulate it. Know your mission.
</li>
  <li>Examine your motives. Make sure that you have a passion for owning a business and for this particular business.
  <li>Be willing to commit to the hours, discipline, continuous learning and the frustrations of owning your own business.</li>
  <li>Conduct a competitive analysis in your market, including products, prices, promotions, advertising, distribution, quality, service, and be aware of the outside influences that affect your business.</li>
  <li>Seek help from other small businesses, vendors, professionals, government agencies, employees, trade associations and trade shows. Be alert and ask questions.</li>
</ol>

  <h2 id="header2nirio">Tips on Building a Sound Business Plan</h2>

  <ol id="ol2nirio">
    <li>Write a business plan with a complete financial and marketing plan.</li>
    <li>
      Your marketing strategy should be built around your strengths, your competitor's weaknesses and your customers' desires.
    </li>
    <li>
      Test the reality of your business-know why it will work and how you will make it work. Think your business through step by step.
    </li>
    <li>Allow at least two hours every week for thinking and planning. Do not allow anything to interfere with this time. You run the business. Don't let it run you.
    </li>
    <li>Establish an annual operating plan. Review it and update it monthly with appropriate employees.</li>
  </ol>
